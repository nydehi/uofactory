I want to merge the advantages from Sphere, RunUO and other UO emulators I know into a single Server. The Code is based on the RunUO Core. I like to provide an scripting interface for RunUO that can be used by anyone, not only programmers and to make RunUO more easy to extend for programmers.

This is a long term project and my take some time to get finished.
